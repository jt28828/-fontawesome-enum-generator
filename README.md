# Fontawesome Enum Generator

## Details
This tool generates enums that contain the Fontawesome unicode values for several languages,
this allows easy access from code.

Icons are generated by pulling the Fontawesome icons.json metadata so it should contain all Fontawesome icons.

## Releases
Releases are triggered manually, I might set it to run whenever the JSON is updated in the Fontawesome repo 
if I can figure out how to connect that in Github at some point.
